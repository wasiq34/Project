I recently completed a data analytics project focused on a Pizza Sales Company, where I transformed raw data into meaningful insights using:

✅ SQL – for data cleaning, joining tables, and deriving key metrics
✅ Power BI – to build an interactive dashboard with visuals on sales trends, top-selling pizzas, customer preferences, and more
✅ MS Word – for compiling a professional project report summarizing the findings and recommendations

The goal was to uncover performance insights such as:

🔝 Best & worst-selling pizzas

📅 Peak order times and weekdays

📈 Revenue trends over time

🧀 Ingredient popularity and customization patterns

It was a great experience combining data extraction, analysis, and visual storytelling. Looking forward to applying these skills to real-world business problems!
